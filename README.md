# WaikUp

Collaborative news sharing platform.

## Introduction

WaikUp is an application for teams who want a collaborative platform to share their
findings around the Web.

## API-centric

This application is entirely built around a RESTful API, allowing to build any interface
on top of it, be it a traditionnal WebUI, a browser extension, or a mobile application.

## Version control workflow

Development of this application and its features use the `git-flow` workflow, to ensure
feature's code are separated from the stable (`master`) branch, and stable code remains,
well... stable!

The complete workflow is explained in details on
[this page](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ "A successful branching model"),
and the `git-flow` utility can be found [here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow "Git-Flow").
